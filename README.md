### Google and Waze Must Stop Sharing Drunken-Driving Checkpoints, New York Police Demand

## Assignment

The NYPD asked Google to stop showing the location of various drunk driving checkpoints, which makes for an interesting discussion relating to privacy and safety laws. I am interested to see if any future legal action comes from this, as it seems like (in my opinion) the NYPD is relatively justified in its complaints. They argued that the only people who would need this information are, in fact, drunk drivers, and Google simply allows them to circumvent the law. Is this a right that the NYPD has to keep this information private? I can't seem to justify any reason why Google would have the right to keep this information public, as it seems to be in nobody's best interest and certainly does not do enough to combat the threat of drunk driving.

I feel as though the title is slightly misleading, as the feature does not explicitly mark drunk driving checkpoints, but police checkpoints in general. It's an interesting feature and I see how it is both useful for those in a rush (as these can slow people down, making them late) like the hazard and accident marking features, and also dangerous (drunk drivers and criminals). I think it will be interesting seeing what legal precedent this will set

"I the NYPD is in the right to do this! Drunk drivers and other influenced drivers pose a risk for society by allowing them to bypass checkpoints. In my opinion this needs to be escalated and overtruned ASAP. I truly don't know who in their right mind would alert others of DUI points" - Rachel
