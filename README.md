## Assignment

The NYPD asked Google to stop showing the location of various drunk driving checkpoints, which makes for an interesting discussion relating to privacy and safety laws. I am interested to see if any future legal action comes from this, as it seems like (in my opinion) the NYPD is relatively justified in its complaints. They argued that the only people who would need this information are, in fact, drunk drivers, and Google simply allows them to circumvent the law. Is this a right that the NYPD has to keep this information private? I can't seem to justify any reason why Google would have the right to keep this information public, as it seems to be in nobody's best interest and certainly does not do enough to combat the threat of drunk driving.
